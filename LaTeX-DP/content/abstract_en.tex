This master thesis is dedicated to designing a non-linear predictive controller on a rotary inverted pendulum, also known as a Furuta Pendulum. The main task is to develop a control strategy, which is capable to perform a Swing-Up control of the pendulum with the following stabilization in the upright position. In this thesis we are designing two control strategies, first is a Heuristic Swing-Up control strategy and the second is an Optimal Swing-Up control strategy. Both of the strategies require the mathematical dynamic model of the pendulum, which we derive using Euler-Lagrange equations. Then we design an Energy-Shaping controller and a Model Predictive Controller for a Heuristic Swing-Up control strategy, and a Non-linear Model Predictive Controller for an Optimal Swing-Up control strategy. The second part of this thesis is dedicated to case studies, where both control strategies are used to control the mathematical representation of the pendulum device.
