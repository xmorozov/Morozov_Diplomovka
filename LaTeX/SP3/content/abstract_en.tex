This work is dedicated to designing control strategies for the rotational inverted pendulum or Furutaâ€™s pendulum. Those strategies are Linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) with the Swing-up controller, Model Predictive Control (MPC) method with the Swing-up controller and the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategy. Those controllers are designed in a computing environment MATLAB, for NMPC has used MATMPC toolbox as well as the CasADi toolbox. After verifying in simulations those controllers are used to control the real process.
